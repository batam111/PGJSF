PGJSF - Was a "Flashlight" saving simulator for a popular game "Dead By Daylight" That I was working on.
It aimed to re-create the flashlight saving mechanic to help users get better at it. The main difficulty of the game
was getting it as close as possible animation wise and timing wise to the original + legal documents to avoid any lawsuits.
